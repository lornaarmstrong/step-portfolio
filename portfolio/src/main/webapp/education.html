        <h3>Educational History</h3>
        <p>This page gives a brief overview of my educational history, from the ages of 11 to 20!
           The map shows the different educational institutions that I have attended, or currently
           attend. As you can see, I went to school and college in England, and I now study in
           Scotland for my university degree.

          <h4>Staindrop Academy</h4>
          <h5>SEP 2011 - JUNE 2016</h5>
          <p>I attended Staindrop Academy (<i>also called Staindrop School - An Academy</i>),
          and studied 13 GCSEs, in the following subjects: Maths,
          English Lit, English Lang, Biology, Chemistry, Phyics, Religious Education, Graphic 
          Products, Geography, French, German, Computer Science, and ICT. In terms of extra-curricular
          activities, I always involved in sport (excluding trampolining, which
          certainly wasn't my favourite!), from boxing to ballet, football to cross country. I was
          Sports Captain for my school house, Deputy Head Girl, Prefect and silver DofE award holder.

          <h4>Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College</h4>
          <h5>SEP 2016 - JUNE 2018</h5>
          <p>To study for my A Levels, I attended QE Sixth Form College in Darlington. It is a 
              high achieving college, and has almost 2000 students across both years. The college
              gets its name from Queen Elizabeth I as she comissioned a grammar school which was the old
              occupier of the site. I did A Levels in: French, Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science.
              In regards to extra-curricular activites, I was a member of Russian and Latin lunch clubs,
              I was a Student Ambassador, and part of a team of 4 students working on French Mentoring program.

          <h4>University of Edinburgh</h4>
          <h5>SEP 2018 - CURRENT</h5>
           <p>I am currently studying as a Computer Science undergraduate, at the University
               of Edinburgh. The 4-year degree covers a range of subjects and modules, but my favourites
               so far have been: Introduction to Data and Analysis, and Introduction to Software Engineering.
               As my elective courses, outside of my degree area, I chose to study Spanish and Arabic. I am
               also a member of Comp Soc, WomenInSTEM and Swing Dance societies. In addition, I spend one hour a
               week volunteering with a local Rainbow GirlGuide group.

          <h3>What's Next?</h3>
          <p>I have no idea! I'd love to study or work abroad, to practice using my language skills, to see a 
              little bit more of the world, and to meet as many new people as I can. Until then, the focus is
              on making the most of my two years left at university, before graduating in the summer of 2022.
